> The insturction for the tasks can be found [here](CA01_EDA_India_Pollution_Instructions.pdf) <br>
> The the python notebook can be found [here](CA01_Oliver_Lin.ipynb)
## Exploratory Analysis:
> In this analysis, we look into some basic info about the dataset such as the columns, missing values, shapes etc. <br>
> <br>
> Then, we clean the data by dropping some irrelevant columns, making sure categorical data is consistent, and add in a year column. <br>
> <br>
> For the missing values, we use the Imputer from sklearn.preprocessing to fill in those missing values in every column with the mean. <br>
> <br>
> Final, we make a few bar charts and line plot to visualize the pollution level and trends over the years. <br>
> Here is a sneak peak of the visualization of the pollution trend:\
