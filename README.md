# 6070-CA01-Exploratory Data Analysis on India Pollution Data with Python
## Data: 
> The dataset consists of India's pollution data from 1990 to 2015.
## Exploratory Analysis:
> In this analysis, we look into some basic info about the dataset such as the columns, missing values, shapes etc. <br>
> Then, we clean the data by dropping some irrelevant columns, making sure categorical data is consistent, and add in a year column. <br>
> For the missing values, we use the Imputer from sklearn.preprocessing to fill in those missing values in every column with the mean. <br>
> Final, we make a few bar charts and line plot to visualize the pollution level and trends over the years. <br>
